\begin{itemize}
\item Better optmization technique - maybe conjugate gradient - took a long time and work + could not really find the parameteres for the N=12 case. Maybe, if I had enough time, I could have found the parameters giving a correct minimum in the energy, but after trying out a lot of different starting guesses for the parameters, different number of MC cycles for each step and different minimization rates without finding a minimum in the energy I figured it was too difficult with the simple gradient descent method. 
\item Not efficient code - new how to do it, but I could not do it. Did not get the correct energies (below ground state energy at omega not 1 - no interaction).
\item Not efficent to which to Eigen notation for matrix in inverse matrix function, should have whiched all code to eigen, but I used the time I had left for analysis etc instead
\item
